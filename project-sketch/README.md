## Discussion ##

For my project I will be visualizing a datset called MovieLens 1m, available here:
http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.

The dataset consists of three files, over 1 million movie ratings by over 6 thousand users on over 4 thousand distinct movies.  I'm interested in conveying a general sense of the dataset as well as discovering the relationships between various types of users and movies.  

In terms of tools, I expect to use R, shiny, ggplot, and GGally.  I'm also likely to explore producing a map using Tableau and possibly two network visualizations, one showing clusters of movies and the other displaying clusters of users.

In terms of techniques, I'm thinking I'll have the following plots (with techniques discussed for each):
