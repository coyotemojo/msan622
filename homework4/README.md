## Instructions ##

- [`get_books.r`](get_books.r) loads the books, processes the text, and produces data frames for plotting
- [`plots.r`](plots.r) code to produce two sets of plots - two bar plots with the most frequent words in each text, a comparison word cloud and a commonality word cloud.

The load data code requires access to a local directory with the text of both books.
